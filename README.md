My best work from MAGD150.



##Black Mirror

Program uses *p5.sound.js* library in order to have sound effects. 
In the preload function, the sound is imported into the program from a .wav file using *loadSound()*. The soundFormats function call before this tells the program that the file formats used will be .wav. In the setup function, the program creates an html element as the header of the screen. It then creates a videocapture, and then hides it so that it can be drawn using *image()* instead and be manipulated more specifically. Next, a sawtooth emulator is created to emulate the sound of sirens. Then, the amplitude of the oscillator is set and the program is started
